          Create a React component (which may have sub-components) which
          implements a two-pane layout:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The input to this component is a <code>data</code> property which
            contains an array of objects with the shape:
          </li>
          <code>
            &#123;
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;title: string
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;content: string[]
            <br />
            &#125;
          </code>
          <li>
            The left pane contains a list of all the <code>title</code>s.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a title is clicked on, it displays the content in the
            right-hand pane, with each string in the <code>content</code> as a
            separate paragraph.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before anything is clicked the right-hand pane should have an empty
            state which tells people to click on a title.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use <code>bulma</code> classes for styling - the library is included
          in the bundle already.

It is the third installment of a projected tetralogy, as well as the final studio album to feature drummer Josh Eppard before his original departure. He was replaced by Chris Pennie who was with the band for their next two albums (although he did not record on No World for Tomorrow due to contractual obligations) before Eppard returned to the band in late 2011. On their previous album, In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3, the phrase "My dearest Apollo, I\'ll be burning Star IV" is written after the lyrics for the song "The Light & the Glass".',
              "The album begins to resolve the issues of Claudio Kilgannon's quest to protect the Keywork, and sheds more light on the demise of Coheed and his wife Cambria. Also, it expands on the issues of the Monstar virus and Jesse's involvement in the saga. A graphic novel based upon the entire story of the album was released on the same day. This album, unlike the others, tells the story from the perspective of the author, known as The Writer, and the ways in which his life and personal demons affect his telling of the Amory Wars narrative.",
